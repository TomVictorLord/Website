<h4>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>

IT has many purposes in modern business ranging from advertisements to the automation of data to the creation of electronic games.<br> People can create websites for businesses using IT which they can make user friendly for people not used to using computers, they can also make advertisements for websites that can show off a product on the side of the screen while someone browses.<br>
People can also create leaflets through programs which can then be printed in mass and sent to peopleâ€™s doors.<br>
They can be used in jobs where spreadsheets come in handy to lower the time used it would take for a human to do it on paper, by automating things such as numbers and registers when people sign in to places.<br>
IT is also a key part of the gaming industry with many different jobs centering around IT exclusive roles such as graphic design, sound recording and creating in-game A.I.<br>
Overall technology has made businesses a lot more time efficient, effective and less costly.
