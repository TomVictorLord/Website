<h4>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h4>

Something that can cause projects to fail is companies not researching their target demographic well enough and not making a lot of sales because of it.<br>
Something else that could cause digital projects to fail is people having different ideas of the outcome of a project and not communicating properly with how they should work together effectively.<br> People might also be working out of their field of expertise, not being utilised to their full potential.<br>
Another risk is your idea being done before you have time to create it so your project could possibly be a copy by the time itâ€™s done.<br> Technology could also improve in the time you're making the project, eg, a game engine becoming outdated and better games being made on a new engine that supasses yours a lot quicker due to more advanced technology.<br>
Harsh deadlines can also cause people to burn out and rush out a product on not great quality.
