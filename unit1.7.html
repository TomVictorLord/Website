<h4>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h4>

Companies need to regularly check the rules in this area as they can frequently change, to make sure no laws are broken.<br> 
Plagiarism can also affect digital projects if it is too similar to another product where they could possibly be sued.<br> 
There are rules covering marketing emails and SMS messages to individuals such as you can only contact people who have already consented to being emailed. You must always put your contact details and a valid return email at the end of an email sent to customers.<br>
Customers must also be told cookies are used on the website and consent, they must also be told how they are used.<br>
GDPR changes how public sector organisations and businesses can handle the information of their customers.<br> Companies covered by the GDPR are accountable for their handling of peopleâ€™s personal information.<br> It also gives people more control over their information and allows them to access it easier and for free.<br>
Sometimes there are breaches in security which can lead to people's personal information being stolen such as email addresses and passwords.<br> The GDPR has the the ability for regulators to fine businesses that don't comply with it.<br>
